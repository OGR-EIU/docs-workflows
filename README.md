# Documentation of POC workflows

Currently there are several workflows:
- data pump worflows (daily and nondaily) + separate manual workflow which takes data from Excel data files
- pre-model transformation workflows
- model forecast workflows
- adhoc job workflows to extract data from the DWH and to report it
